		<h1>An Argument For Dogs:</h1>
			<article>
				<p>In my argument for dogs I will be explainging the benefits they provide. Dogs are great companions since the beginnings of civilization. Humans domesticated these friends a very long time ago and have been inseperable ever since. There are many benefits to having a dog in your family. They bring joy and happiness with their presence alone. They promote a healthy living style as responsible owners will need to walk them to provide excercise. Dogs are typically great with kids and can provide companionship to seniors as well meaning they are great for an entire lifetime. </p>

   <h1> An Argument Against Dogs:</h1>
   <article>
   	<p>For my arguement against dogs I will be the using the unpredictable behaviour and there constant chewing. Dogs like most animals react to their surroundings in different ways but most of the time dogs choose to be aggressive. This kind of behaviour is why many people fear dogs or have trauma from dog attacks. Several dogs have been put down after biting people because once they get the taste for blood it oesnt stop with one person. Now on the chewing or gnawing which is very costly depending on what dogs chew up. Several items have been lost in many homes each year to dogs chewing them up. If not for muzzles dogs would chew up anything you own so this something that really make dogs not good pets.</p>
