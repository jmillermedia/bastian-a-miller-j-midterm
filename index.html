		<h1>An Argument For Dogs:</h1>
			<article>
				<p>In my argument for dogs I will be explainging the benefits they provide. Dogs are great companions since the beginnings of civilization. Humans domesticated these friends a very long time ago and have been inseperable ever since. There are many benefits to having a dog in your family. They bring joy and happiness with their presence alone. They promote a healthy living style as responsible owners will need to walk them to provide excercise. Dogs are typically great with kids and can provide companionship to seniors as well meaning they are great for an entire lifetime. </p>
